I began by automating tasks through block logic —an early introduction to computational thinking— and soon found myself exploring real programming languages to push the boundaries of what was possible. This initial spark transformed my view of entertainment into a clear professional goal: to master software development and contribute to the industry, combining logic and imagination to create unforgettable digital experiences.",
